 		<h1>Meditation Techniques</h1>
 		<h3>Best way to relax is to meditate, here is the best 5 meditation techinques to do</h3>

 		<ol>
 			<li>Walking meditation
 			    <div>Find a space outside, and simply walk at a slow or medium pace, focusing on your feet. Try to distinguish when your toe touches down the ground, when your foot is flat on the ground and when your toe points back upward. Feel the roll of your foot. Observe sensory details: a tingle here, a pull of the sock there.

 			</li>
 			<br>
 			<li>Candle Staring
 				 <div> If you have trouble focusing, you can light a candle and stare at it. Your attention will be held. If your mind races, just observe what it is doing and let those thoughts release.
 				 </div>

 			</li>
 			<br>
 			<li>Breathing Practice
 			    <div>If nerves are getting you down before a big game or match, try breathing exercises to help center yourself and feel more calm. Simply focusing on your breath -- rather than your nerves -- can help you prep for better performance. Try lying on your back and placing a hand over your belly. Breathe so deeply that your hand rises over your belly and then push the air back out again. Repeat until you feel more in control of your nerves.

 			</li>
 			<br>
 			<li>Visualization
   				<div>Another easy and down-to-earth meditation technique is to picture an idyllic being or setting in your mind. Focus on the picture and let yourself embellish it as much or as little as you need to.
   				</div>
   			</li>
   			<br>
   			<li>Present Moment Meditation
				<div>Close your eyes and begin to focus on your breath. Take a few moments here then allow your focus to broaden to your body and the sensations that it's feeling. Now expand your focus to anything touching your body, noticing those sensations. Lastly, expand your awareness to everything you can hear and sense. Now reverse this process and come back, one step at a time to your breath.
