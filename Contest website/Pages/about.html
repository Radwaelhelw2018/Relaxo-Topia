 		<H1> Who are we? </h1>
 		<p> We are two students at Vodafone STEM for her program. Radwa Elhelw, a 19 years old girl who studies engineering at the American University in Cairo. <br>
 		Eman Alaa, a sophomore student at Computer and Information sciences Ain-shams university. We both are passionate about technology. Based on our researches we decided to create a website to help people manage stress and relax.</p>
 		<br>
 		<h1> Why are we creating this website?</h1>
 		<p> We are creating this website to help people get out from these over-whelming thoughts and stress that can affect negatively from various aspects. Physically, stress can cause severe diseases and heart problems. Socially, stress can lead to social anxiety disorder(SAD) which is a mental disorder that makes the person unable to communicate with any person and has fear from any social interaction. Last but not least, it can destroy the brain chemistry and change the brains psychology </p>
		<br>
		<h1> From where did we get the data used on the website? </h1>
 		<p> Using research papers and other websites.<br>We built our background information regarding this topic, which helped us later on to pursue this idea. </p>
