 		<h1><center>MOOD BOSTERS</h1></center>
 		<center><h3>There are four free methods that can help you de-stress which are: </h3></center>

 		<ol>
 			<li>Laughter
 			    <p>Laughter is of particular note because there are scientific studies that lend support to the notion that laughing is beneficial for your health. In one such study, Japanese researchers discovered that diabetics enjoyed a significantly smaller spike in blood sugar after a meal when they watched a comedy show, compared to listening to a “boring lecture.”

 			<br>
 			<li>Music
 				 <p> Listening to relaxing music or taking a short walk outdoors are also effective ways of unplugging from the chaos of daily life.

 			</li>
 			<br>
 			<li>Nature
 			    <p> Reseaches has proven that spending time in a visual appealing setting can act like a mood booster; such as, setting in front of the sea, watching the stars in a clear night, a quiet green park full of birds or any other natural theme that can be relaxing.

 			<li>Making Time for Family—and Pets!
   				<p>It goes without saying that making time for your family is important and should be a priority.

                 But did you know that having a dog as a companion could add years to your life? Two studies have shown that owning a dog can play a significant role in survival rates for heart attack victims.

                 Other studies have shown that the presence of animals reduces the anxiety you feel when facing stressful situations.

                 And there have been numerous studies demonstrating that petting a cat can improve your mental and physical health, including lowering blood pressure. One study from the University of Minnesota found that cat owners are less likely to die by heart attack or stroke than cat-less people—by 30 to 40 percent! (3)

                 So, don’t discount the importance of taking time out of your day to play with Fido or Fluffy. Not only will it benefit your four-legged family members, but your own health as well
