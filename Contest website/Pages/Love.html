		<h1>How much time do you spend with your family or the ones you love?</h1>
		<p>Well if the answer is "not much" or "I am busy" etc.., then you should take a break from whatever you are doing such as your job and go sit with the people you love. <br> Talk with them about life and topics you enjoy, laugh, eat and have fun.Don't talk about problems but try to relax and have a good time for a moment.
